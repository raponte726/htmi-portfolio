<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Rafael and i am a Web Developer's student. I graduated with my degree in Banking, finances and insures back in 2000. 
I chose that field of study because Iâ€™ve always been interested in finance and money, and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options, too..
 Now since i have always loved technology and designing i decided to start studying to be a Web Developer.</p>
